# MinecraftServerToTray
Minimize Minecraft server console window to system tray

This is a simple script that checks if the minecraft console window has been minimized and if so, moves it to the system tray instead.
This script depends on usage of a batch file to start the server which utilizes the title command to put a specific title on the console window.
